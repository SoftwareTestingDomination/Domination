<a href="https://github.com/jibrankhan/Domination">github</a>.
 	</p>

    <p>31.03.2013 -
    Many people have been saying the dice are not fair in the game, well they are!
    When the dice are rolled the game has no idea who it is rolling the dice for,
    (in situations where both get the same value, the defender wins)
    the code that generates the dice numbers is <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/domination/code/HEAD/tree/Domination/src/net/yura/domination/engine/core/RiskGame.java#l2451">here</a>
    as you can see it does no check to see whos turn it is, or if it is the attacking
    dice or defending dice, it simply generates the numbers from the java <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">Random</a> object.</p>

    <p>18.03.2013 - The main maps in Domination do not have movement route between the territories of East Africa and Middle East
    (luca.map, geoscape.map, sersom.map, world.map) but if you want to play with the link there are also many map available that
    do feature that link such as (risk.map, Risiko_Klassisch.map, OriginalRisk1975.map, fran_risk.map, Nafta-Risk-V2.map)
    so search for these map in the MapStore if you like to play with the link present.</p>
